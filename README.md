# FuAPI

[FuAPI](https://fuapp.vercel.app) is a simple REST API that provides fake users data for your projects or testing.

It is intended to be a community maintained application.
## Why?

To practice my skills with Node.js and React.js I decided to create a project with some value for other people. I think a REST API is good for doing this.

I also want to improve this project over time. Of course I appreciate all feedback.
## Resources

Actually FuAPI has 2 main resources:

- Users https://fuapp.vercel.app/api/v1/users
